Q1. Evaluating Simple Expressions
1. 3+8=11
2. 3^2=9
3. 2^3^4==(2^3)^4 - FALSE
4. 2^3^4==2^(3^4) - TRUE
5. 0==1 || 0/=1 - TRUE
6: "h" : "ello" - charactor concat with string (Hello)
7. 7 : [6, 5, 4] - list concat
8. if 0==1 then "Alice" else "Bob" - Bob
9. let sqr = \ n -> n^2 in sqr 3 + sqr 4 - Using a Lamba function to define squares before doing something.
10. let cube n = n^3 in cube 2 + cube 3 - Using a function to define cubes and using it in an expression.

Q3. Detecting Errors
1.if 0 then "a" else "b" - if clause doesn't contain anything to be mapped to boolean.
2.if "a" == "b" then 5 - must use if/then/else pattern in Haskell.
3.if "a" = "b" then 5 else 4 - singleton equals doesn't work for equality.
4. if 0 == 0 then 5 else 'b' - must return an int or a string
5. ["0", 5, 9] - List of multiple types cannot exist.
6. ("a", 42 - Missing closing parenthesis.
7. let sumSq m n = m^2 - n^2 in sumSq 3 4 - Plus instead of the minus.
8. let f (x:xs) = 42 in f [] - need to define a pattern for the empty list.
9. let f n = if n == 0 then 0 else f (n+1) in f 3 - No reachable base case.
10. * 2 3 - Need bracket around the multiplication.
11. "3333" :: Int - Its a string!

Q4. Simple expressions that use values defined in Prelude
1. fst, snd - First and second value from given tuple.
2. curry, uncurry - Pack and unpack a tuple input.
3. succ, pred - Next and previous value (+/- 1: numeric values)
4. negate, abs, signum - change sign, get value w/o sign and
get sign.
5. quot, rem, div, mod, divMod - division related functions.
6. gcd - greater common divisor
7. id, const, (.) - returns itself
